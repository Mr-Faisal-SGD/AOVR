      <div class="answer">
        Staking is when you lock AOVR tokens over a certain time span. In
        return, you receive a share of the weekly minted new
        <span class="span1">AOVR</span> tokens. While your tokens, are staked
        you cannot send them to other wallets cast votes wihte them in the
        <span class="span1">ALLOVR DAO</span> or make use of any other utility
        the tokens hold. However, it is completely up to you how many tokens if
        any youâ€™d like to stake.
